# AI / Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository contains a curated collection of **machine learning and artificial intelligence projects** developed using **Python and PyTorch**.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate a strong understanding of:
- Core machine learning concepts
- Neural networks and deep learning
- Model training and evaluation
- Clean, readable, and well-documented code

Each project is self-contained and includes documentation explaining the problem, approach, and results.
