# AI / Machine Learning Portfolio

This repository contains a curated collection of **machine learning and artificial intelligence projects** developed using **Python and PyTorch**.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate a strong understanding of:
- Core machine learning concepts
- Neural networks and deep learning
- Model training and evaluation
- Clean, readable, and well-documented code

Each project is self-contained and includes documentation explaining the problem, approach, and results.

- Bag-of-Words (BoW) and TF-IDF feature representations
- Classical NLP classification models
- Word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, and contextual embeddings)

### 🧩 Deep Learning for NLP
- Neural network–based text classifiers
- Embedding layers and learned representations
- Sequence models (RNNs / LSTMs)
- Transformer-based architectures (introductory projects)

### 🖼️ Computer Vision
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification
- Transfer learning with pretrained models
