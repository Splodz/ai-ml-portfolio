# IMDb Sentiment Analysis (NLP with scikit-learn)

This project performs **sentiment analysis on movie reviews** from the IMDb dataset, classifying reviews as **positive** or **negative** using classical Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised machine learning.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate a **complete NLP pipeline**, from raw text to model interpretation, using industry-standard tools.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given a movie review written in natural language, predict whether the sentiment expressed is:

- **Positive (1)**
- **Negative (0)**

This is a **supervised binary classification** problem with:
- **Text input**
- **Integer labels**
- **Pre-labeled training data**
